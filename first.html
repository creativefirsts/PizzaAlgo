        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to give semantic meaning to text on a document</p>
        <p> Here is a look at the syntax rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elements have names</li>
            <li>Elements typically have opening and closing tags</li>
            <li>An element example would be: &lt;h1>&lt;/h1></li>
        </ul>
        <p>HTML has two types of elements: block and inline</p>
